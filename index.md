# BatteryInformer Windows Application

### Welcome to BatteryInformer HomePage

This app use something like **40-80 rule**, but not exactly. :laughing:

> The rule is to keep your battery charged at somewhere between 40% and 80% level at all time. This should prevent the above stated "stresses", which in turn should keep the batteries last longer.

### Features : 
1. 5 Second notification if battery level is between 85 to 90 percent.
2. Permanent notification if battery level in over 90 percent.
3. Stop monitoring and close notification prior to disconnect power line.
